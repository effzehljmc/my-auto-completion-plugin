# AI Implementation Research Notes

## Overview
The implementation of AI capabilities in our note-taking application requires careful consideration of various components and their integration.

## Technical Requirements
- OpenAI API integration
- Token management system
- Context-aware processing
- Memory management for conversation history

## Implementation Approach
We've decided to use GPT-4 as our primary model due to its superior context understanding and ability to handle complex tasks.

### Key Components
1. AIService - Core service handling API communication
2. ChatAgentService - Manages user interactions
3. CommandService - Handles command parsing and execution
4. MemoryService - Manages conversation context

## Challenges
- Token limit optimization needed
- Response time improvements required
- Better error handling implementation
- Context window management

## Next Steps
1. Implement better prompt engineering
2. Add response caching
3. Optimize token usage
4. Improve error recovery mechanisms
